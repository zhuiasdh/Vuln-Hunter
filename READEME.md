# 🕸️ VulnHunter - Network Vulnerability Scanner

## 🚀 Overview
"VulnHunter is a Python-based reconnaissance tool that goes beyond simple port scanning. It scans target networks for open ports, identifies running services (Banner Grabbing), and cross-references version numbers against the Vulners database to identify real-time Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). All results are aggregated into a user-friendly Web Interface for easy analysis."

## 🛠️ Features
- **Port Scanning:** Identifies open ports and running services.
- **Service Enumeration:** Detects service versions (e.g., Apache 2.4.49).
- **Vulnerability Mapping:** Queries the Vulners database for CVEs.
- **Web Interface:** Clean, responsive dashboard built with Flask & Bootstrap.
- **Reporting:** Generates detailed HTML reports for each scan.
